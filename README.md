File "Medicare_Part_D_Opioid_Prescriber_Summary_File_2014.csv" downloaded from https://data.cms.gov/Medicare-Claims/Medicare-Part-D-Opioid-Prescriber-Summary-File-201/e4ka-3ncx/data.

Description of the file:

"The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has prepared a public data set, the Medicare Part D Opioid Prescriber Summary File, which presents information on the individual opioid prescribing rates of health providers that participate in Medicare Part D program. This file is a prescriber-level data set that provides data on the number and percentage of prescription claims (includes new prescriptions and refills) for opioid drugs, and contains information on each providerâ€™s name, specialty, state, and ZIP code. This summary file was derived from the 2014 Part D Prescriber Summary Table (Documentation available at: https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Downloads/Prescriber_Methods.pdf)"
