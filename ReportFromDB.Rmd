# Purpose

The main purpose of this document is to back the statements made in the manuscript entitled "*Variation in Opioid Prescribing Practices Among Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgeons by State from 2013 to 2017: A Retrospective Cohort Study*", but also to describe the methodology applied to the data in order to aggregate and present the results discussed in the manuscript.

Below we set the path to the database to be used as source, as well as each table that will be used throughout the analysis.
```{r load_db}

db <-'/home/dfcoelho/Downloads/tyler.db'
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), db)
PUF_tb <- tbl(con, "PUF")
SF_tb <- tbl(con, "SummaryFiles")
FPMRS_tb <- tbl(con, "FPMRS")
ACOG_tb <- tbl(con, "Crosswalk_ACOG_Districts")
DOMS_tb <- tbl(con, "DrugOverdoseMortalityByState")
NPPES_tb <- tbl(con, "NPPES")
OPIOIDS_tb <- tbl(con, "OPIOIDS")
```

Then we get the list of FPMRS practitioners and store in the variable `FPMRS`, set a list of abbreviations to be filtered out from the list of states. This is followed by a query to build a dataset of opioid prescribing rates at NPI level.  

There are a few entries in which `bene_count` or `total_claim_count` is equal to NA. That may lead to over count of one of the fields, so we remove any entries in which at least one of the fields is NA.

Here we actually are able to compare the results from the SummaryFiles and PUF tables, which shows that the somehow the datasets don't actually match after similar aggregation. The only possibility here is to verify the PUF data source.

```{r merge_data}
FPMRS <- FPMRS_tb %>% collect()

  mutate(State = fct_drop(State), Specialty = factor(Specialty)) %>%
  # Then we create a variable to hold the opioid count.

  mutate(
    opioid_claim_count = ifelse(
      drug_name %in% OPIOIDS_list | generic_name %in% OPIOIDS_list, 
      total_claim_count, 0)) %>%
  # Then we group by NPI / Year / Specialty to have an aggregation to a

  group_by(Year, NPI, NPPESProviderLastName, NPPESProviderFirstName, State,

  summarise(.groups = "drop",
    OpioidClaimCount = sum(opioid_claim_count),
    TotalBeneCount = sum(bene_count),
    TotalClaimCount = sum(total_claim_count),
    RXRate = 100*OpioidClaimCount/TotalClaimCount
  ) %>% arrange(NPI, Year)


```

For now, I considered the opioidRX we generated from the PUF files as the correct and continued the analysis.

```{r fpmrs_data}

  summarise(OpioidClaimCount = round(mean(OpioidClaimCount),0)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% filter(OpioidClaimCount < 10) 

rmd_fpmrs_data <- opioidRX %>% group_by(NPI) %>% 
  summarise(OpioidClaimCount = round(mean(OpioidClaimCount),0)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% summarise(LE10 = sum(OpioidClaimCount <= 10),
                          GT10 = sum(OpioidClaimCount > 10)) %>% 
  mutate(P_LE10 = round(100*LE10/(LE10 + GT10),0), 
         P_GT10 = round(100*GT10/(LE10 + GT10),0))

```

A total of `r rmd_total_fpmrs` Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgeons (FPMRS) were identified in the Part D Prescriber Public Use File: `r rmd_fpmrs_data$LE10` (`r rmd_fpmrs_data$P_LE10`%) prescribed 0-10 opioid claims, and `r rmd_fpmrs_data$GT10` (`r rmd_fpmrs_data$P_GT10`%) prescribed more than 10 opioid claims to Medicare Part D patients.

```{r query_1}

Among FPMRS prescribing at least 10 opioid claims in the Part D Prescriber PUF, a total of `r format(total_count$total_claim_count, digits = 0, big.mark = ",")` opioid claims were prescribed to `r format(total_count$total_bene_count, digits = 0, big.mark = ",")` beneficiaries (Table 1).  Each FPMRS prescribed to a mean (SD) of `r round(stats_claims$mean_claim, 1)` (`r round(stats_claims$sd_claim, 1)`) opioid claims to a mean of `r round(stats_claims$mean_bene, 1)` (`r round(stats_claims$sd_bene, 1)`) beneficiaries.  

Each beneficiary received a mean of `r round(stats_claims$mean_claim/stats_claims$mean_bene,1)` opioid claims, with a supply lasting a mean of `r round(stats_claims$mean_supply, 1)` days.  

```{r drug_stats}
# As we want to present data regarding the statistics of each opioid, we group
# the data by the opioid name and calculate the total claim count and percentage
# of each drug
stats_opioids <- claims %>% 
  filter(drug_name %in% OPIOIDS_list | generic_name %in% OPIOIDS_list) %>%

  mutate(claim_percentage = round(100 * claim_count / sum(claim_count), 1)) %>%

```

Combination hydrocodone-acetaminophen accounted for `r format(sum(stats_opioids[1, 2]), digits = 0, big.mark = ",")` opioid claims (`r format(stats_opioids[1, 3] %>% unlist(use.names = FALSE), digits = 0, big.mark = ",")` %), oxycodone acetaminophen `r format(sum(stats_opioids[2, 2]), digits = 0, big.mark = ",")` opioid claims (`r format(sum(stats_opioids[2, 3]), digits = 0, big.mark = ",")`%), followed by tramadol hydrochloride `r format(sum(stats_opioids[3, 2]), digits = 0, big.mark = ",")` opioid claims (`r format(sum(stats_opioids[3, 3]), digits = 0, big.mark = ",")` %), and lastly oxycodone `r format(sum(stats_opioids[4, 2]), digits = 0, big.mark = ",")` opioid claims (`r format(sum(stats_opioids[4, 3]), digits = 0, big.mark = ",")`%).


```{r region_count}
# Here the changes concern me a bit, after removing all entries in which 
# the beneficiary count or the total claim is NA, the sample size decreased 
# significantly and the number of states with mean < 1% near half the number
# of states.
#
# Then I observed what I described on Slack:
# I was checking the states with near zero median and I found out that the values are actually right, since there are a reasonable amount of practitioners that prescribed 0% opioids. In turn, that pushed the median to zero. Closely inspecting the data, I could see that a fair amount of those practitioners had a reduced claimTotal value. So in the median calculation, the practitioner that had 100 claims over the years had the same impact of a practitioner with 10000+ total claim. What if we calculate a weighted median using the total_claim as weight? So the FPMRS that prescribed 10000 drugs (opioids or not) would have a higher impact in the median than a FPMRS what only prescribed 1000 drugs in the same period.
#
# So I calculated the median of OPR but weighted the results by each NPI's
# claim Total, so in a given state the OPR of a professional that prescribed 
# hundreds of opioids would impact more than a professional with fewer 
# prescriptions. Why do I think that is correct?
# Because medians make more sense to be calculated with a higher granularity level, as if we had one entry per patient and the prescription for that individual. Then, in that situation, if we aggregated to the state level, the median would be "self-weighted". As we don't have this level of information, weighting it by the number of prescriptions would virtually approximate the results.

The median opioid prescribing rate for FPMRS in `r paste0(paste0(abbr2state(bottom_opr[1:length(bottom_opr)-1]), collapse = ", "), " and ", abbr2state(bottom_opr[length(bottom_opr)]))` is zero, or effectively zero.  FPMRS in `r paste0(paste0(abbr2state(top_opr[1:2]), collapse = ", "), " and ", abbr2state(top_opr[3]))` have the highest median prescribing rates, which are above `r round(state_OpioidPR %>% arrange(desc(opioidPR)) %>% select(opioidPR) %>% unlist(use.names = FALSE) %>% .[3], 1)`%.  The top 5% of opioid prescribers were located in `r paste0(paste0(abbr2state(top_5_states[1:length(top_5_states)-1]), collapse = ", "), " and ", abbr2state(top_5_states[length(top_5_states)]))`.   

The median opioid prescription rate for prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D across FPMRS was `r opioidRX %>% summarise(median_OPR=median(RXRate)) %>% unlist(use.names = FALSE) %>% round(1)`% from 2013 to 2017. 

A 95% interval for the MEDIAN opioid prescription rate for prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D across FPMRS from 2013 to 2017 was `r opioidRX %>% select(RXRate) %>% smedian.hilow(.,conf.int=.95) %>% round(., 2)` (Median, Lower, Upper).

A 95% interval for the MEAN opioid prescription rate for prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D across FPMRS from 2013 to 2017 was `r opioidRX %>% select(RXRate) %>% smean.cl.boot(.,conf.int=.95) %>% round(., 2)` (Mean, Lower, Upper).

The total amount of beneficiaries that received prescriptions from FPMRS (only those with 10+ prescriptions were considered) and from the TOP5% prescribers are:

`r tbl_bene <- as.data.frame(cbind(t(claims_10pp), t(claims_5pp))); names(tbl_bene) <- c("Total_Beneficiaries", "Total_Beneficiaries_top5"); tbl_bene`

There are `r length(top_5_prescribers)` FPMRS that are considered the top 5% prescribers. Also, `r claims %>% filter(drug_name %in% OPIOIDS_list, total_claim_count > 10) %>% distinct(NPI) %>% nrow()` FPMRS prescribed more than 10 opioids claims.

The top 6 most prescribed drugs are:

`r table_1`

total_30_day_fill_count  - Median number of Opioid Claims prescribed.
Only prescribers with `total_claim_count > 10` were considered.
`r table_total_30_day_fill_count`

total_30_day_fill_count_5pp - Median number of 30 day fill count Opioid Claims prescribed by the top 5% prescribers.

Only prescribers with `total_claim_count > 10` were considered.

`r table_total_30_day_fill_count_5pp`

total_claim_count - Median number of Opioid Claims prescribed

`r table_total_claim_count`


There are only 69 rows in which `total_30_day_fill_count != total_claim_count`, so total_claim_count_5pp will be virtually equal to table_total_30_day_fill_count_5pp.

total_claim_count_5pp - Median number of Opioid Claims prescribed by the top 5 prescribers.

`r table_total_claim_count_5pp`

total_day_supply - Median value of the total amount of days for which a drug was dispensed.

```

The opioid prescription rate across FPMRS, whose prescriptions were covered by Medicare Part D, from 2013 to 2017 was `r round(100*fpmrs_prescription$total_opioid/fpmrs_prescription$total,1)`%. 

```{r total_opioid_pr}

    total_opioid = sum(total_opioid_count, na.rm = TRUE)

```

These FPMRS providers prescribed a total of `r format(fpmrs_prescription$total_opioid, digits = 2, big.mark = ",")` opioid prescriptions or `r round(100*(fpmrs_prescription$total_opioid/total_opioid_prescription$total_opioid), 3)`% of all opioid prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D from 2013 to 2017.
